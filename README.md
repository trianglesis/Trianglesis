I'm mainly using:
- Oracle Linux
- Apache2
- RabbitMQ
- ESXi/VCenter
- WSL
- MySQL
- Python

With Python, I like:
- Django
- Celery
- pyVmomy
- paramiko

I like to automate things, but I'm not an automation tester. 
I like to deploy things automatically, but I'm not a DevOps.

In my spare time, I play with:
- Raspberry
- HomeAssistant
- OpenWRT
- ESP32
- literally, PC games
- heavyweights
